The event started as a small harvest festival in 1982 to showcase the area's diverse agricultural products.With heavy involvement from Cornell and a partnership with
downtown merchants including David Abdulky and Lyle McCartney,the event was strictly a farmers market. Over time, the addition of food and craft vendors, games, and other activities for children grew the event into what it is today. The event attracts an audience of over 30,000 patrons over the three days.

What is one interesting fact about Ithaca that visitors might learn while attending this festival? Ithaca was named by Bon Appetit Magazine as one of the foodiest towns in America and is home to the famous Moosewood Restaurant. Ithaca has more restaurants per capita than New York City and its unique placement as an urban center within an agricultural region allows for amazing farm to table cuisine. Our farmers market is one of the best in the country and the ice cream sundae was invented here! Apple Harvest festival embodies this spirit in bringing our culinary and agricultural values to the forefront.
