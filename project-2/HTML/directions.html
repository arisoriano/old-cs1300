The festival takes place in the heart of Downtown Ithaca. It starts on the 100 W. Block of State Street and continues through the Commons east toward Cornell University. The walking path of the festival takes you by the large mural project in the Commons of over 200 different art pieces by local organizations and artists. It also leads you by the historic State Theatre, Ithaca Commons, Restaurant Row, and the Community School of Music and Arts (CSMA).
The festival will have an additional entertainment area added this year. It is on the east end of the Commons by the CSMA. Here you will find a variety of farm goods, children's entertainment and a new sound stage for performance. As the Commons undergoes a historic transformation, we are expanding the footprint of the festival.
