			New Attractions	
			</h1> 
			The CSMA East End Entertainment Area is a new addition for 2013. This fun filled area, chock full of Amish baked goods, local harvest season produce, beer and wine tasting, and a main performance stage, is a new exploration into the local charm of downtown Ithaca. Strong local performers take the stage by day to bring us wonderful dance, song and unique street performances for the duration of the festival. In the evening on Saturday, October 5, entertainment such as The Alash Ensemble and masters of Tuvan throat singing can be found between 8pm - 11pm inside the CSMA as part of their 6th Annual Arts for All Marathon!
			The Aurora Street Fairway introduces a fun filled children's play area to The Apple Harvest Festival. This wonderful street fair, located on the 200 block of North Aurora Street, is a timeless journey down memory lane. Here you can get lost in the charm of waiting for a turn on the ferris wheel, tasting homemade ice cream, or watching street performers. Family fun may even result in a charity fund raising " pie in the face" for a local student group.

			Past Favorites
			</h1> 
			Your favorites can still be found in 2013 with some new flair to check out at each new hub. Tasty treats and artistic ware can still be found as usual on the West End of the Commons by the State Theater. There's a new sound stage to be found on the steps of the State Theatre. Farm goods galore can be found at the new CSMA East End Entertainment Area while families and children are encouraged to visit the Aurora Street Fairway, host to candy apples, jugglers and the ferris wheel.
