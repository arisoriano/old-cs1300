		This site was created as a quick and easy to comprehend resource for
		anyone looking to shed those extra pounds that won't seem to come off.
		Although there is no "correct" order in which you should navigate the
		site, it would make sense to start at Nutrition, and go right across
		the navigation pane on the top of the webpage. First things first, you
		will need these three S's before you begin.
		
		<ol>
		<li>Strong Will</li>
		<li>Solid Support Newtwork</li>
		<li>Strong Motivation</li>
		</ol>
		<h1 class = "reg">What are the 3 S's?</h1>
		You will need to first make up your resolve to change your life (Strong
		Will). Losing
		weight is not about dieting, you will ultimately fail if you treat it
		that way. Losing weight is about CHANGING completely. It is a lifestyle
		change as this site repeatedly states. Old habits die hard they say? Well
		new habits grow soft! It takes a long time to get into a new routine (its
		estimated to take around 21 days of repetitive behavior to form a new habit).
		In addition to resolve, you need a Solid Support System of friends, families, or
		lovers--anyone that can tolerate your
		potential issues and complaints. It will be hard so you need to have people
		around that care enough about you to cheer you on and encourage you on an
		endeavor of this size. Lastly, the most important S, is a Strong Motivationun.
		Looking "hot" or being "beach-ready" is not a good enough motivation to losing
		weight. Dig deeper and find what makes you the most unhappy about your weight.
		Mosty likely, you will also find what triggered your weight gain in the first
		place.
		<p>When you have these things, then you can proceed.</p>
