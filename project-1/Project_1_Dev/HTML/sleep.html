			As stated in the exercise section of this website, we burn calories
			just by being alive. Given a regular 8 hour minimum sleep schedule,
			you can burn around 800 calories per good night's rest! That's what
			I call a freebie--sleeping your way to weight loss. In addition,
			sleep provides an essential rebooting time that your body needs
			in order to function optimally. I will be discussing how sleep affects
			three specific aspects of dieting including metabolism, hunger, and
			cognitive functions.
			<h1 class="reg">Lack of Sleep and its Effects: Ghrelin</h1>
			A continual lack of necessary sleep (8-9 hours normally for 20 yr
			olds and younger and 5-6 hours for older folks) results in a spike
			in a hormone called ghrelin. It is caused by a spike in blood glucose into
			the system, that a well-rested body can normally handle. What does this hormone
			do? Without going into specifics, it is the cause of your hunger. More ghrelin in
			your system equals more hunger which leads to overeating and weight gain! So get your Zzzz's!
