			Thoeretically, losing weight is simple: burn more calories than
			you take in. Yet if it were that easy, then the millions of people
			looking to shed pounds would all be skinny. Having said that, lets
			look at some simple math for a second.
			<h1>Weight Loss Math</h1>
			If you didn't know, one pound of human body weight is approximately
			equal to 3,500 calories. So in order to lose one pound you must have
			a net loss of 3,500 calories. We can easily see this in the following
			equation:
			<p><b><blockquote>Caloric Intake (Calories Eaten) -
			Caloric Output (Calories Burned) = Net Calories</b></blockquote></p>
			As you can see from the formula there can either be a positve or
			negative net calories. You always want a negative number of net
			calories, indicating loss of calories and hence weight. A positve
			amount, obviously means you gained weight, by eating more than you
			burn.
