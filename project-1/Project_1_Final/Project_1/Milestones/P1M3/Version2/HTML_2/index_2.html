			In a country where about 2 in every 3 people are at
			least overweight, its no surprise that many Americans strive to lose weight.
			Unfortunately, for most, losing the extra pounds is not as simple as opening
			up a "How To Lose Weight in X Amount of Days", subscribing to expensive
			programs like WeightWatchers, or even jumping aboard the "fad" diet train wreck.
			This site aims to change all that. Losing weight is not methodically difficult.
			It requires one to permanently change some lifestyle habits that contribute to
			their weight issues.
			The difficult aspect of weight loss is getting the motivation to start and
			keeping the will power to maintain one's progress.
			Get started here.
