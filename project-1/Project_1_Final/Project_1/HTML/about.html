                    My name is Ariel and this is my story.
                    
                    <h1 class = "reg">The Somber History</h1>
                    Ever since I can remember I have been obese. Surprisingly
                    enough, no one else in my immediate family is or was. The
                    youngest of three brothers, I was the odd child out growing
                    up prefering to read inside as opposed to joining my superbly
                    athletic brothers outside for a game of basketball or
                    handball (a local NYC sport). I believe my reasoning for not
                    wanting to participate in the physically demanding activities
                    my siblings were partaking of was because of two words: <em>
                    low confidence</em>. The only thing I believed I could muster
                    were
                    the words in my beloved fantasy books and textbooks, nothing
                    else. As you can imagine, such a sedentary livestyle did not
                    complement my body at all and the pounds just kept
                    accumulating. That is when I decided to take action and have
                    my body catch up to what I percieved my true persona to be:
                    healthy and happy. Enough was enough: my obesity was not
                    going to define my identity.
                    
                    <h1 class = "reg">Why I Needed to Lose Weight</h1>
                    Being overweight not only takes a toll on your overall
                    physical health (from joint issues, respiratory problems,
                    disease, you name it) but also your mental state of being.
                    Through most of my teen and young adult life I have endured
                    the psychological torment of my weight, manifested in too
                    many ways to count. There was no quality of life for me, no
                    solace despite having every material thing I needed.
                    
                    <h1 class = "reg">Why I Want To Help</h1>
                    Through my website, I want to educate anyone who is willing
                    to put in 110% of their effort into changing their lifestyles
                    and losing the weight they desire, for health, social, mental,
                    or any reason conceivable. Mainly, though, I want to save people
                    like me before they go through the struggles I did battling
                    my obesity. No one should have to go through that.
                    
                    <h1 class = "reg">How to Use this Site</h1>
                    I learned how to permanently change my unhealthy habits
                    and have successfully lost over 80 lbs -- and kept it off.
                    Because of this, I am confident that I can show and instruct
                    you on how slim down to a more healthy and manageable weight.
