			Thoeretically, losing weight is simple: burn more
			calories than you take in. Yet if it were that easy,
			then the millions of people looking to shed pounds would
			all be skinny. Having said that, lets look at some
			simple math for a second.
			<h1 class = "reg">Weight Loss Math</h1>
			If you didn't know, one pound of human body weight is
			approximately equal to 3,500 calories. So in order to
			lose one pound you must have a net loss of 3,500
			calories. We can easily see this in the following
			equation:
			<p><b><blockquote>Caloric Intake (Calories Eaten) -
			Caloric Output (Calories Burned) = Net Calories</b>
			</blockquote></p>
			As you can see from the formula there can either be a
			positve or negative net calories. You always want a
			negative number of net calories, indicating loss of
			calories and hence weight. A positve amount,
			obviously means you gained weight, by eating more
			than you burned.
			<h1 class = "reg">BMI Calculator</h1>
			You always want to know where you stand with your weight,
			there is no room for guessing, in any goal you make
			actually. Calculate your BMI with the calculator on the left.
			<h1 class = "reg">Glycemic Index of Foods</h1>
			What is the Glycemic Index, essentially it how well your blood
			absorbs and spreads sugar out throughout the body. Some foods
			give your circulatory system a hard time or "higher load" due to
			more carbohydrates and sugars and work. Generally you want to consume
			low glycemic foods to avoid hunger spikes and overeating.
