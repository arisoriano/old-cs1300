		In a country where about 2 in every 3 people are at
		least overweight, its no surprise that many Americans strive
		to lose weight. Unfortunately, for most, losing the extra
		pounds is not as simple as opening up a "How To Lose Weight
		in X Amount of Days", subscribing to expensive programs like
		WeightWatchers, or even jumping aboard the "fad" diet train
		wreck. This site aims to change all that. Losing weight is
		not methodically difficult. It requires one to permanently
		change some lifestyle habits that contribute to their weight
		issues. The difficult aspect of weight loss is getting the
		motivation to start and keeping the will power to maintain
		one's progress. Have a look at this amazing video narrated by
		Giavanni Ruffin, running back for North Carolina to get an idea
		how motivation is sprouted:
