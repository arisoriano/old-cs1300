						<h2>How We Arrive at a Finished Product</h2>
						Wild Cider believes that it has a competitive advantage
						for several reasons. The first is that we use our resources
						to minimize costs. Our apples are harvested for free (aside
						from the opportunity cost and the cost of gas), instead of
						purchasing the apples in bulk or maintaining an orchard,
						both costly endeavors. Furthermore, we draw upon our
						connections early in the startup process to minimize fixed costs,
						as we rented equipment needed for picking the apples very
						inexpensively. All of these frugal acts enable us to brew
						250 gallons of our cider at low costs.
						Comparable cider companies sell cider at $12.00 per
						.75 Liter, giving us plenty of room to the decrease price of
						our cider if it is not being sold fast enough.<br>
						<p></p>
						Wild Cider also has the competitive advantage that we
						are the only organic, home-brewed cider company in
						the Ithaca area. None of our competitors practice an organic
						process. Because Ithacans are very food conscious,
						we believe that this fact will give us an edge when
						selling our brew. So even though we are selling our
						cider at the same price as the other locally owned
						cidery, we believe that because our process is organic
						and efficient we will be able to sell our cider quickly
						and for a high price.

					<h2>Video - Milling Process</h2>
					To the right is a short clip of the milling phase in our cider making process where
					a staff member has fed local "wild" apples into the fruit mill to
					be processed. The mill pulverizes the apples into a pulp, which
					is then strategicially laid out on a sterile filter to drain via a hose
					mechanism. The juice is then extracted by a hydraulic press (as shown in the
					photo above) when layers of pulp are stacked on top of each either yielding
					an unrefined cider product that is ready for the next phase--fermentation--
					where it becomes Wild Cider's hard cider.
