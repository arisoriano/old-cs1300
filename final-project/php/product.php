						<h2>What We Sell</h2>
						Our company takes apples from untended
						apple trees and presses them into hard cider.
						We brew small batches of carefully crafted
						hard apple cider in a variety of flavors
						from different locales. Our cider is made
						from organic, unsprayed, local apples, and
						is comparable to other fruit wines. It is
						also touted as a gluten-free alternative to
						beer. We market our cider in reusable
						ball jars, emphasizing our commitment to reuse.
						<p></p>
						<h2>Advantages of Buying our Hard Cider</h2>
						There are many benefits of purchasing hard cider
						from Wild Cider including:
						<ul>
							<li>
							Supporting a local green product.
							We are dedicated to creating a completely
							organically produced and low-transportation
							product.
							</li>
							<li>
							Introducing an organic cidery to the Ithaca area
							at some point during our business&#39;s
							growth. There is no such comparable
							cidery in the area.
							</li>
							<li>
							Encouraging customers&#39; passion for cider by
							providing quality customer service and
							organic ingredients. We aim to
							boost cider sales in the area closer
							to the level of wine sales.
							</li>
							<p></p>
						</ul>
