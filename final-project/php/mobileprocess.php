					<h2>How We Arrive at a Finished Product</h2>
					
					Wild Cider believes that it has a competitive advantage
					for several reasons. The first is that we use our resources
					to minimize costs. Our apples are harvested for free (aside
					from the opportunity cost and the cost of gas), instead of
					purchasing the apples in bulk or maintaining an orchard,
					both costly endeavors. Furthermore, we draw upon our
					connections early in the startup process to minimize fixed costs,
					as we rented equipment needed for picking the apples very
					inexpensively. All of these frugal acts enable us to brew
					250 gallons of our cider at low costs.
					Comparable cider companies sell cider at $12.00 per
					.75 Liter, giving us plenty of room to decrease the price of
					our cider if it is not being sold fast enough.
					<p></p>
					Wild Cider also has the competitive advantage that we
					are the only organic, home-brewed cider company in
					the Ithaca area. None of our competitors practice an organic
					process. Because Ithacans are very food conscious,
					we believe that this fact will give us an edge when
					selling our brew. So even though we are selling our
					cider at the same price as the other locally owned
					cidery, we believe that because our process is organic
					and efficient we will be able to sell our cider quickly
					and for a high price.
